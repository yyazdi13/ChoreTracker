This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

ChoreTracker

A full-stack web application created to help parents and their children to organize chores. Many times children lose track of who's turn it is to complete an assigned chore. At the same time parents want to teach their children that we work to earn money. It isn't just given to you when get good grades in school.

ChoreTracker allows chores to be assigned to a child while also displaying the amount to be earned for completing that chore. Once the chore is completed the child simply clicks "Done". The child can choose to cash out thier earnings or save for later use; like purchasing their favorite toy or video game. As a bonus the child can choose a reward such as more game time, one-on-one time with Mom or Dad.

Technolgies Used:
1. React
2. ExpressJs
3. MongoDb
4. BcryptJs
5. Material -UI

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
